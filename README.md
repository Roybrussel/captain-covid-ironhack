CLASSIFIED BULLETIN
Captain, I'll be honest with you: Our defenses are crippled. It has become clear that the enemy is not of human nature, but something more terrifying: Contagious Oversized Viral Infectious Diseases (COVIDs)!

A new cluster is onthe way, and we need you to deliver the experimental vaccine directly into the cold, dead hearts of each of these COVIDs. Your ship has been outfitted with the latest and greatest PPE (Personal Protective Engine) to assist you in your mission.

How many COVIDs can you take on? Select your cluster difficulty level using the drop-down menu. Remember that each COVID that slips past your defenses counts against you, so choose wisely...

Your mission is clear, Captain: Emerge from your social-distancing lockdown to reclaim what belongs to us!
