CAPTAIN COVID, I'll be honest with you: Our strengths are crippled, and only the strong ones will survive. It has become clear that the enemy is not of human nature, but something more terrifying. We need to ensure the safety of all Ironhackers.  

Trials are underway of an EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE, but time is running out. We need humanity's best pilot on the job to deliver the injections directly into the cold, dead heart of the VIRUS BODIES (VBs).  Your mission is clear: Emerge from lockdown to reclaim what belongs to us! 

You have just been outfitted with the latest and greatest PPE (PERSONAL PROTECTIVE ENGINE) to assist your fight. Your PPE console contains your score count as well as your health meter; we've calculated that you can only withstand coming into direct contact with two VBs before succumbing. 

How many VBs can you take on? Select your DIFFICULTY LEVEL using the drop-down menu. Remember, each VB that slips past your defenses counts against your score count. Choose wisely, but never forget that humanity needs all the help it can get. 

Once you're ready to LAUNCH the mission, maneuver your PPE using the LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys, delivering the injection payloads into the VBs with the SPACEBAR. 

Captain Covid, we're counting on you.  Don't fail us!
