Captain Covid, your mission is clear: Emerge from lockdown to reclaim what belongs to us! Humanity's strengths are crippled, and only the strong ones will survive. It has become clear that the enemy is not of human nature, but something more terrifying. We need to ensure the safety of all Ironhackers.

How many virus bodies can you take on? Select your DIFFICULTY LEVEL using the drop-down menu. Choose wisely, but just know that humanity needs all the help it can get. 

When you're ready to LAUNCH the mission, maneuver your PERSONAL PROTECTIVE ENGINE (PPE) using the LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys, deliver the experimental vaccine injections directly into the cold, dead heart of the virus using the SPACEBAR.

Captain Covid, we're counting on you.  Don't fail us!
